# Third-Party Notices

WhisperSubTranslate is GPL-3.0 licensed, but it bundles, downloads, or links to
several third-party components with their own licenses. This document lists
them for attribution. Each component remains the property of its respective
copyright holder; their licenses apply to their own code and models, not to
WhisperSubTranslate itself.

## Notes

- **FFmpeg**: distributed by `ffmpeg-static` under GPL-3.0-or-later. The app
  uses FFmpeg for audio conversion only (no re-broadcasting of FFmpeg
  functionality), invoked as a separate process.
- **Hy-MT2**: Apache-2.0. Tencent's official evaluation and technical report:
  <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.22064>.
- **whisper.cpp models**: distributed under the MIT license by the ggml-org
  project; the model files themselves are made available under that license.
- **Faster-Whisper-XXL**: a standalone repackaging of
  [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) (MIT) with
  CUDA runtime libraries bundled; see its repository for the exact terms of
  the distributed archive.
- External APIs and services used only when you configure your own keys
  (DeepL, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, custom OpenAI-compatible
  endpoints, MyMemory) are governed by their own terms of service and are not
  redistributed by this app.
